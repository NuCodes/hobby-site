                <p>This is a hobby site created for my Week 2 project with The Developer Academy.</p>
                <p>I have chosen to create a site about a squirrel we have befriended and nicknamed 'Sammy'. </p>
                <p>We first met him whilst out on an evening walk at a local park, in late September 2020. We spotted him looking at us and as we slowly approached him, rather than running away, he moved closer to us and seemed as curious about us as we were about him. Before we left the park that evening, we promised him we would return the next day with nuts and the rest is history...</p>
                <p>The links below navigate to a collection of photos and videos I have as we have got to know him over the past few months.</p>
